the weird .txt files you may find here are part of some of

Some people may need to install the 'bc' calculator
because it's not done automatically for some systems

     not giving enough/giving too much space can in 
     certain situtation cause program-breaking errors

reminder: this was written on a kali linux machine
          thus the shell path is #!/bin/bash, on your 
          device it may be different (e.g. /usr/bin/bash)
          so be sure to double check or you'll get an error.
          And obviously have the bash shell installed or some 
          interpreter for it. 

The basics folder will probably be the most useful one
since it contains all basic things one will do in bash.
All files are written as easy examples and have comments too

It's helpful tho

One Thing: not all files have executable permission since 
           there's too many. Either run them with `bash <file>`
           or just add the permission yourself with `chmod +x <file>`
